### 3D - visualisation

Repo for project for learning OpenGL and matrices usage for 3D graphics.

All homeworks are in homework0N/ directories, where N is 1, 2, 3, ...

Executables are also there (although they're not ".exe" as I'm on Linux, do I really need to crosscompile it?). F. e.: ```cd homework01; ./homework01```
